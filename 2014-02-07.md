#February 7th Meeting with Mike

##Attendees:
Lewis, Tom, Laura, Simon, John, Kit, Mike and Stefano

##Update of work
Work that had been done for the past week was discussed.

* Showing the work done to the D3 Grid.
* Chatting about what format the JSON should be in.
* Reporting that we were having problems with the header and footer.
* Showing the Sanity check queries  - Extracting grants by topics
	* discussing the sanity checks.
* Going over the plan that has been drafted.
* Discussing the results of running real time.

##Potential Risks
* Possibly there could be a large computation time with creating wordles
* SOM may take a while to get working.
* When Modelling against another university it may be difficult to get accurate results as to pick the correct amount/same topics in a list.
	* Will it be good to compare this or a waste of time ?

##D3
* Creating wordle real time ?
* Save the location of the wordle ?
* Provide graphs for : 
	* School against Time
	* Grants against Time
	* Each Topic
		* Total spend for HW divided by each school
		* How the grants are doing in terms of money granted, checking for areas that are increasing or decreasing
* Colour code wordles according to which school they belong too.
* Refresh the screen when a wordle is clicked and the full screen sized graph is shown instead of a pop up, allow this page to click through to information about individual schools.
* Have individual words searchable - Perhaps changing colour of searched element
* Allow functionality for the page to be bookmarked.
* Check out **www2.../~cm39** for a grid example which allows click through to wordle and graph.

### D3 - Critical/Priority
* Start thinking about the SOM - Stefano was giving us some MATLAB script for this.
* Hex Map with worldes
* Click through :
	* Graphs - Stacked Area.
		* Click through for individual schools.
* We need to think about data that can be off line and not computed at real time.

##Database
* There was mention of using RCUK database
	* 6 * bigger
	* Other schools use it for grants.
	* As much data as possible
	* Stefano was going to make this available for us

##TO-DO
* Have a working prototype done with wordles in the grid that are clickable to another page with graphs which are then clickable to view information about certain schools of interest.
* Look at SOM that stefano is giving us
* Update documents
	* Evolve the requirements as we go along.
* Think about the 'Nice to have' Comparing other Universities data.
* Look at craigs version of the Hex Grid, take the code as we need in order to get a prototype done ASAP
* Update the progress report
	* **Start maintaining a personal diary detailing the work you have done which has to be agreed at the student meeting, this is IMPORTANT.**

##Next Meeting
* Thursday **13th** February @ **10:15am**
