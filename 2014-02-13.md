## Minutes

### Marking
Mike will require us to produce some kind of individual documentation pack - including 
* details of work done (log/diary)
* any documentation contributed to - clearly outlining individual contribution
* any software code contributed to - clearly outlining individual contribution
  * outline percentage of work which is your own (i.e. if taken from d3 example)
  * only include if this percentage is reasonable
* Mike will also carry out individual interviews to discuss the code and ensure members can explain what they have changed and what it does
* Document any challenges overcome - what the challenge was how you overcame it
Mike will go into more detail on this documentation pack in the next meeting.

### Work completed this week
* Wordles have been attempted - still need to get working properly but tests going well
* Haven't had a change to look at the SOM matlab code properly as only given yesterday
  * speak to Iain McCrone if Matlab not accessible on university machines
  * speak to Dave in the lab if any issues with Matlab while Stefano/Mike are away
* Stacked Area Chart example 
  * graph shown - need to document design decisions 
    * what the decision is
    * benefits of decision
    * why decision made
  * for particular data in example maybe a stacked bar chart instead of area

Consider using a smaller topic set (100 instead of 1000 topics) as the topics for the whole of the UK may be too broad for just HW
Get Proportions correclty - use current proprtions SUM these and use this to normalise the proportions in a new table just for HW

Need to look into Graph asthetics - colours, fonts, layout etc. Document this

Ideas:
* topic heat map of UK
* Map collaborations between HW and other universities 
  * depending on data this could be overall or per topic
  * [Mike] Two types of Information to map:
    * Topic distribution across UK
    * connections between investigators
    
Mallet 
John to document work he has done on Mallet/how topic modelling works as not needed but needs marked in some way
Do need - Use existing topic model (in FTP) to run Mallet against new grants. Stefano currently re-runs the new database and replaces old DB

Look into layout of graphs for universities and what format they should be in. 

**Document any research done as evidence for marking!**

When ready go see Paul Thompson.

May get access to Cordus once Stefano gets back.

**Update Task List.**
