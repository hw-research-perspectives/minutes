# January 22nd Meeting with Paul Thompson

## Attendees
Paul Thompson

Lewis, Tom and Laura

## Minutes
Paul showed us what data he has and what he currently does with the data he has.
Data he has is for Proposals and Awards, he will be giving us the awards data to start off with.

Some of the data include: creation, award, start and end dates; Principle Investigator (he will also give us a seperate table with Collaborators to join to); values/costs; school; company; title

What Paul currently uses the data for:
* Forecasts - to see how well the university might do in future years given current projects and proposed projects
* Distribution of Funds
* Projections for future
* Estimating success rate
* Yearly/Monthly overviews

Some uses Paul would like:
* "sandpits" - identify key interests in different schools, in order to generate more proposals
* recruitmemt - research strengths in comparison to rest of Scotland/UK to show where recruitmemt may be needed to improve areas of weakness

Paul can give us as much data as necessary and will provide it in excel spredsheet form. To work around any possible issues with privacy can remove company names and use a group code instead. 

Decided on data from 2001-present with lists of collaborators alongside. Sent to us after the meeting via email.

Other ideas for using the data: tracking individual contributions to projects, and finding out percentage work of collaborators.

This will be discussed in the next meeting tomorrow 10.15am.
