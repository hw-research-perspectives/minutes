# Janurary 21st Meeting 

## Attendees:
Mike, Stefano and Craig
Kit, John, Lewis, Laura and Tom

## Minutes
Define tasks with the minimum of people assigned
Record minutes of the meetings for usage in marking and refering back to what hass been said.

Tasks as Mike sees it:

* GUI - D3.js etc
* Basic Requirements including sketches of user diagrams
* Backend - topic modelling

Probably have to use Gateway To Research (GTR) data set and will try to focus on large topic sets.
Mike reckons that the number of documents might be too small so we might have to work using the previously defined topic set

Possible risks as identified in the meeting are :

* topic modelling changing
* getting summaries as thte access database provided by Paul Thompson doesn't have the summaries
* trends for dates, investigators, money, summary, grants, title

It is required that we document weekly what everyone has done for the week and thiss should be donw in meetings before the main meeting with Mike.

Website should be self explanatory with no need for user instruction (using a short screencast might be useful) No longer than 2 minutes.

We should look at augmenting the existing database in order to make it more interoperable with the current work.

We should investigate the use of different graphical options when looking at how we should display the data.

### Draft of Users
* Management - useful for doing trend analysis looking at funding changes and school wide trends (HoS and Dep Principal)
* Research Enterprise Services - reporting tool (Paul Thompson is the contact there)
* Industrial - looking for people of specific skill sets and attached bodies of work
* Prospective PHDs - looking for the specific research that they are most interested in
* Collaborators
* Research Profile - wide look at what the university is starting to specialise in

### More Risks

Are the current topics specific enough? If not we may have to use a much smaller by more targeted set.


Next Meeting with Mike : Friday 24th January 11:15

To-Do before then :

* Set up and have meeting with Paul Thompson to define some user requirements and also touch on the data
* Split work into a set of tasks and provisionally assign so we have some idea who is responsible for what
