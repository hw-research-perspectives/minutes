# January 28th Meeting

## Attendees:
Stefano

Lewis, Simon, Tom and Laura

## Minutes
Stefano apologised for not sending the information - did not have email address for MEng mailing list.

FTP server and database details given to us - using PHP MyAdmin. We should be able to create new tables at ~30Mb.

Files include example scripts for PHP conections and Header/Footer for site, so it matches existing site layout. 

1,000 topics provided, will need to run some topic modelling. EPSRC data included, will be provided with RCUK data as well. As the tables are so big may need seperate databases for them.

American DB - decided not critical and is ~10x the size of the UK/EU DBs combined. Can maybe document as nice to have?

Still to do:
* getting abstracts (Risk)
* getting data from Excel document to DB tables (Risk)
* look into topic inference - some info should be provided in files from Stefano

Implementation currently uses images for wordles and hexgrid uses vector graphics. Should look into a different way to implement which would make it easier to change later on.

Any questions send Stefano an email - or if lots of questions drop by the lab and he will try and help.
