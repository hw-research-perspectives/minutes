* It was discussed to checkout 'David M. Blei' as he has a good paper on Topic Modelling.

* Spend Profile of topics.
	* Money spent per month is linear - temporal information on how the money is spent would be good.


* Paul Thompson has a PURE database which is believed has all papers associated with staff at HW.
	* It would be worthwhile for the person dealing with the Database to go have a look at this database to see exactly what is in it.
	* Check to see if it has the abstracts also ? 
* Mike said initially it would be good to get a prototype up and running using the epsic data, having functionality that would allow for;
