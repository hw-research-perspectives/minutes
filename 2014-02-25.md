# February 25th Group Meeting

## Attendees
Laura, Tom, Lewis, Simon
Late : John, Kit (tried to email but bounced back) 

## Minutes
Lewis now has SOM data from Kit - needs to be organised better as currently there are some hexagons with up to 8 topics assigned and this is not feasible. Will be looked into this week and brought up in next meeting if still not got it working.

SQL queries are still a work in progress for getting data in correct format - Simon attempted a query that is too expensive to use but will continue to optimise it.

Tom has been looking into map data for Geolocation graphs - trying to get a working demo.

Things that should be looked into soon:
* colour coding the wordles based on largest school contribution
* some kind of magnification tool to work around an issue with sizing on different screens
* need to figure out how to get multiple wordles on one hexagon in the grid - d3 does not seem to easily support this.

Graphs needed still:
* Monthly spend 
* map data graphs
* stacked area -> stacked bar

Need to clarify which database we should be using and check if the RCUK database is in the same format as EPSRC for querying etc. Do we need Topic Inference on the EPSRC data against the RCUK topics?

Tasks this week:
* Lewis - D3 hexgrid, colour coding schemes, get hexgrid working using the SOM data
* Tom - graphing data on maps, get stacked bar chart working, look into magnification 
* Laura - work on queries for getting map data and getting monthly spend data
* Simon - work on queries on database/getting it into the right format for PHP/Front End
* John - Find out if EPSRC data needs to be run through Mallet against RCUK topics, look into whether structure of RCUK database is the same as EPSRC
* Kit - Look into monthly spend graphs in d3, use Craigs as example

## Next Meeting
