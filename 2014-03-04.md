# March 4th Meeting

## Attendees
Lewis,Laura, Tom, Simon
Mike, Stefano

Late : Kit and John (Bus was full)

##Minutes
Starting off by noting what each person had done since the previous meeting : 


* Lewis : Working on the hexgrid with one wordle and updating the SOM file with the new data
* Tom & Laura: Working on having a grouped bar chart with wordle having graphs for contribution from each school for individual topics.
* Laura : Fixing the views and tables in the database by collaborating with Stefano as there was a problem with ID's in the DB.
* Simon : Been working on optimising the query so it can actually be run - managed to run it by converting to a script, queries could be used for other universities - this is untested.

###SOM
* Remove topics from the list based on a money cut off value - a kind of threshold for heriot watt - this should make the hex grid more compact. Perhaps find the annual income for HW and perhaps topics that have 100th of the annual income are left out.

###Wordle
* Use the top 5 words for the wordles as no way is it going to be possible with 20 words.

###Features
* Paul Thomson wanted some functionality to view schools contribution.

###Next
* Needing to start glueing the pages together
* Some of the static data files need to be converted into queries that can be used.
* Matlab changed to output the SOM in a better format
####Priorites
* Getting something in the prototype that is useful to Paul.
* The project needs to be up datable and maintainable for someone else to pick up the project.
* Paul needs to be able to add projects - whether it be through a csv file upload or from a web form.

###Risks
* Hex Grid is a lower risk.
* Topic output for SOM

###Documentation
* Start thinking about what user documents will be needed.
* Outline of the software.
* Top level design - Major chunks of the code and how they interacts and show the dataflow from each chunk showing inputs and outputs of each software file.

##Next Meetings
* Thu 6th March 10.15 - Group Meeting
* Tue 11th March 10.15 - W/ Mike
