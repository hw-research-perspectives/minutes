# February 27th Meeting

## Attendees
Laura, Tom, Simon, Kit, John
Mike, Stefano

Late : Lewis (previous lecture over ran)

## Minutes
No working prototype yet - getting SOM working with Hexgrid is taking longer than expected.

Work done last 2 weeks since last meeting with Mike:
* John - Mallet
* Kit - getting SOM working with topic model
* Simon - working on getting TSV format - database query 
* Lewis - working on the Hexgrid - getting layout correct with data from SOM
* Laura - SQL queries, documentation
* Tom - D3 Map graphs

People need to remember to put work on Github (for code) or Google Docs (for documents) to ensure the group knows what work is being completed.

Work that needs to be done:
* create a script to run new documents through Mallet/Update SOM
  * Mike suggested also thinking about deleting projects but these may be useful for historic data so perhaps just change queries to get after a certain date
* SOM needs to be run for RCUK database for Heriot Watt Grants/Topics
* Get Hexgrid working with SOM - can display one wordle per hexagon for now and then try and solve the problem with too many topics per hexagon
* Query the database to get any irrelevant topics that may occur
* Query database to get the topic words for wordles
* Need to think about documentation for users (i.e. Paul Thompson) and documentation on architecture
* Change stacked area to stacked bar chart - query for database possibly broken down into smaller queries
* Update risks document
  * D3 hexagons not able to have more than one wordle inside
  * SQL queries take too long to run
  * Usability of User Interface

RCUK database has most of the same things as EPSRC but not Collaborators - seen to be not an issue as we should not need to use collaborators
Confirmed we will be using JUST the RCUK database

## Next Meeting
Tuesday 10.15 with Mike
